# Basic end-to-end tests

This package is preserved in the cloned projects. It performs very basic e2e
tests ensuring that all apps work.

It is recommended to

- Have just one test per app
- Keep tests minimal
- Make tests project-agnostic
- Not add new tests unless
  - It's needed for a new app
  - It's a test for a critical feature
